                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Arizona and Indiana with 13 years of experience in the mental health field. My journey has taken me through community mental health settings and private practice, giving me a comprehensive understanding of diverse mental health needs.</p>
                        
                        <p>I am EMDR Level 1 and 2 trained and find deep fulfillment in trauma work. Originally from Arizona, where I lived most of my life, I recently moved to northeast Indiana and now provide telehealth services to clients in both states.</p>
                        
                        <p>My passion for mental health stems from my own lived experiences, which have created a foundation of empathy and understanding that drives my commitment to supporting others. There's nothing more rewarding than witnessing the growth and healing that happens when people feel truly seen and supported.</p>
                        
                        <p>When I'm not working, you'll find me in nature (especially near water), enjoying audiobooks while reading physical books, cheering on my Arizona Wildcats, or spending quality time with my family.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h3>What can I expect in our first session?</h3>
                <p>Our first session will focus on getting to know you and understanding what brought you to therapy. We'll discuss your goals, my approach, and answer any questions you have about the process.</p>
                
                <h3>How long are therapy sessions?</h3>
                <p>Individual therapy sessions are typically 50 minutes long. EMDR sessions may sometimes run longer depending on where we are in the process.</p>
                
                <h3>How often will we meet?</h3>
                <p>Most clients benefit from weekly sessions initially, though this can be adjusted based on your needs and preferences.</p>
                
                <h3>Is telehealth as effective as in-person therapy?</h3>
                <p>Research shows that telehealth can be just as effective as in-person therapy for many concerns. I use a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform to ensure your privacy and safety.</p>
                
                <h3>What is EMDR and who can benefit from it?</h3>
                <p>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is an evidence-based treatment primarily used for trauma and PTSD. It can also be helpful for anxiety, phobias, and other distressing experiences.</p>
                
                <h3>How do I know if we're a good fit?</h3>
                <p>The therapeutic relationship is crucial to successful outcomes. I offer a brief consultation to help us both determine if we're a good match before scheduling your first appointment.</p>
